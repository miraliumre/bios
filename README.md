# BIOS

Welcome to the **RETÂ·MOE BIOS Repository**! This repository offers a curated
selection of resources and challenges dedicated to the exploration and
understanding of BIOS reverse engineering and firmware modification.

While our focus primarily lies on legacy PC firmware, we are in the process of
developing a new repository solely dedicated to UEFI, expected to be launched
soon.

## Challenges

Embark on a journey through varying levels of challenges tailored to provide a
hands-on experience in BIOS reverse engineering and modification.

### Beginner

Perfect for individuals new to BIOS firmware, these challenges require no prior
coding knowledge. They serve as an excellent introduction to BIOS modification
tools like CBROM and MMTool.

- [A Silent Boot]
- [Absolute Virtualization]
- [Twinkle Twinkle Energy Star]

### Intermediate

These challenges demand a fundamental understanding of 16-bit assembly
programming for x86 architecture, and basic proficiency in analyzing and
modifying binary programs using reverse engineering tools such as [Ghidra] or
[radare]. A basic grasp of BIOS firmware structure is beneficial.

- [A Tale Of Memories]
- [Manic PiXiE Dream Boot]
- [The Disappearance Of The PC Speaker]

### Advanced

For the seasoned explorers, these challenges necessitate a deeper comprehension
of BIOS firmware, specific motherboard designs, and the x86 architecture. They
pose a more complex, time-demanding venture even for the experienced.

- [Code In Abyss]
- [Load Me From The ROM]
- [Rewrite The Bytes]
