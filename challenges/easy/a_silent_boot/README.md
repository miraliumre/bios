### Goal

Replace the full-screen image that the BIOS displays during the Power-On Self-
Test (POST) with an image of your choice.

### Details

Certain BIOS versions offer the option for the Original Equipment Manufacturer
(OEM) to display a custom full-screen image during the POST screen. This
feature, referred to as "silent boot" in AMI documents, replaces the
conventional technical boot information. The intention behind this may be to
make the system appear more user-friendly to the end customer whilst bolstering
brand presence.

However, sometimes these images can be rather unappealing. Even if they're not,
they may not sit well with advanced users who have a preference for
customization or those who want to feel more in control of their machine.

Fortunately, it's usually quite straightforward to replace these images. For
this challenge, your goal is to give it a try.

### Hints

No hints are available for this challenge.
