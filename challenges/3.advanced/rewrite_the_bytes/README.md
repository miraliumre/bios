# Rewrite The Bytes

![Award Modular BIOS v6.00PG]

> _What if we rewrite the bytes? Say they were made for that board? Nothing_
> _could keep it from starting if we found the code we are meant to patch._

### Objective

Install a BIOS from one manufacturer on a motherboard that was originally
fitted with a BIOS from a different manufacturer. For example, make a version
of Award Modular BIOS function on a motherboard that was initially equiped with
AMIBIOS.

#### Conditions

It's essential to note that the aim entails modifying the firmware personally.
Merely replacing the existing firmware with another version that already
supports the specific board, such as [coreboot], does not align with the
objective of this task. The sole exception to this guideline is if there's a
necessity to alter the firmware â€” for instance, if coreboot doesn't already
support your board, and you opt to implement that support independently.

### Overview

A common misbelief is that BIOS firmware is exclusively engineered from scratch
for each motherboard. In reality, several components of the BIOS are
standardized across diverse motherboards. This implies that discovering a
motherboard analogous to yours, especially one sharing the same chipset, might
render the process of adapting its BIOS to your motherboard less daunting than
one might anticipate.

This challenge encompasses identifying two distinct motherboards with BIOSes
crafted by different manufacturers, for example, one with Award Modular BIOS
and another with AMIBIOS. The objective is to enable the BIOS from one
motherboard to function on the other; for instance, executing the Award Modular
BIOS on the motherboard initially provisioned with AMIBIOS.
