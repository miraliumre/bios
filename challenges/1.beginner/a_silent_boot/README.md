### Objective

Replace the standard full-screen image displayed during the BIOS POST with an
image of your own choice.

### Overview

Certain BIOS versions allow the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) to
exhibit a custom full-screen image during the POST screen, often referred to as
"silent boot" in AMI documents, replacing the conventional technical boot
information. This feature is typically aimed at creating a more user-friendly
appearance and promoting brand visibility to the end customer.

However, the default images can sometimes be unappealing, especially to
advanced users who cherish customization and the sense of control over their
systems.

This challenge invites you to change that image to one of your own choosing,
adding a personal touch or perhaps a dash of humor to the booting process.

### Hints

No specific guidance is provided for this challenge.
